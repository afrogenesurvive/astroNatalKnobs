## Why was it made??

- As a fan of astrology myself, when reading a natal chart, I found it tedious to leave through at least 3 sections of an astrology book or finding 2 or more articles to reference one aspect on the natal chart. I wanted to make a quick reference for myself and a tool for other fans of astrology to learn from.

## How was it made??

- Made using:
  - React w/ Create React App
  - HTML Canvas
  - Deployed w/ Netlify
  - Bootstrap
  - Dev Notes:
